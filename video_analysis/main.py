### An example of the simplest formula for difficulty score: a rating for each factor (out of 100 perhaps?), 
# multiplied by coefficients that represent the factor's weight. So we also need to find a way to convert each
# raw measurement into a percentage rating. But the main objective of the new study is basically to find the
# coefficients (or fit a new formula to the actual data on the independent vs dependent variable graph)
# NOTE: not sure if the difficulty score needs to be relative to a user or an absolute score (relative to the
# language as a whole?)

# Coefficients to weigh the factors in the difficulty score
LEXICAL_WEIGHT = 0.4
PHONETIC_WEIGHT = 0.3
