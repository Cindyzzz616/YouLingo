This module contains subroutines for initialization.

Translated from Zaikun Zhang's modern-Fortran reference implementation in PRIMA.

Dedicated to late Professor M. J. D. Powell FRS (1936--2015).

    This subroutine does the initialization concerning X, function values, and

    '''
    This function initializes the filter (XFILT, etc) that will be used when selecting
    x at the end of the solver.
    N.B.:
    1. Why not initialize the filters using XHIST, etc? Because the history is empty if
    the user chooses not to output it.
    2. We decouple INITXFC and INITFILT so that it is easier to parallelize the former
    if needed.
