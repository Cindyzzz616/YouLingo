    '''
    `bounds` can either be an object with the properties lb and ub, or a list of tuples
    indicating a lower bound and an upper bound for each variable. If the list contains
    fewer entries than the length of x0, the remaining entries will generated as -/+ infinity.
    Some examples of valid lists of tuple, assuming len(x0) == 3:
    [(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)] -> returns [0, 2, 4], [1, 3, 5]
    [(0, 1), (None, 3)]      -> returns [0, -inf, -inf], [1, 3, inf]
    [(0, 1), (-np.inf, 3)]   -> returns [0, -inf, -inf], [1, 3, inf]
