'''
This is a module evaluating the objective/constraint function with Nan/Inf handling.

Translated from Zaikun Zhang's modern-Fortran reference implementation in PRIMA.

Dedicated to late Professor M. J. D. Powell FRS (1936--2015).

Python translation by Nickolai Belakovski.

    This function moderates the constraint value, the constraint demanding this value
