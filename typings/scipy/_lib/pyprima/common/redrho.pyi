Translated from Zaikun Zhang's modern-Fortran reference implementation in PRIMA.

Dedicated to late Professor M. J. D. Powell FRS (1936--2015).

    This function calculates RHO when it needs to be reduced.
    The scheme is shared by UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA. For COBYLA, Powell's code reduces RHO by
    'RHO *= 0.5; if RHO <= 1.5 * RHOEND: RHO = RHOEND' as specified in (11) of the COBYLA
    paper. However, this scheme seems to work better, especially after we introduce DELTA.
