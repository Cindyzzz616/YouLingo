'''
This module provides some functions that print messages to terminal/files.

Translated from Zaikun Zhang's modern-Fortran reference implementation in PRIMA.

Dedicated to late Professor M. J. D. Powell FRS (1936--2015).

Python translation by Nickolai Belakovski.

N.B.:
1. In case parallelism is desirable (especially during initialization), the functions may
have to be modified or disabled due to the IO operations.
2. IPRINT indicates the level of verbosity, which increases with the absolute value of IPRINT.
IPRINT = +/-3 can be expensive due to high IO operations.
