class Crop(Effect):
    """Effect to crop a clip to get a new clip in which just a rectangular
    subregion of the original clip is conserved. `x1,y1` indicates the top left
    corner and `x2,y2` is the lower right corner of the cropped region. All
    coordinates are in pixels. Float numbers are accepted.

    To crop an arbitrary rectangle:

    >>> Crop(x1=50, y1=60, x2=460, y2=275)

    Only remove the part above y=30:

    >>> Crop(y1=30)

    Crop a rectangle that starts 10 pixels left and is 200px wide

    >>> Crop(x1=10, width=200)

    Crop a rectangle centered in x,y=(300,400), width=50, height=150 :

    >>> Crop(x_center=300, y_center=400, width=50, height=150)

    Any combination of the above should work, like for this rectangle
    centered in x=300, with explicit y-boundaries:

    >>> Crop(x_center=300, width=400, y1=100, y2=600)
